HTTP and HTTPS are **application layer protocols** that operate primarily on the **OSI model** and **TCP/IP model**. Here’s an explanation of which layers are involved and how HTTP/HTTPS fit into these networking models.

## **1. OSI Model and HTTP/HTTPS**
The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model** has 7 layers. HTTP and HTTPS belong to the **Application Layer** in this model, but several other layers work together to ensure communication:

1. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**:  
   - **HTTP/HTTPS** reside here.  
   - This layer manages high-level protocols, including the formatting of requests and responses (e.g., GET, POST).

2. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**:  
   - Uses **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**.  
   - HTTP and HTTPS rely on **TCP** to ensure reliable transmission of data (three-way handshake, retransmission, etc.).

3. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**:  
   - Uses **IP (Internet Protocol)** to route packets between sender and receiver.

4. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**:  
   - Manages physical addressing (e.g., MAC addresses) and error detection.

5. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**:  
   - The hardware-level transmission medium (e.g., Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi).

In summary, HTTP/HTTPS functions primarily at the **application layer** but depend on **TCP** (at the transport layer) for data delivery.

## **2. TCP/IP Model and HTTP/HTTPS**
In the **TCP/IP model** (which is more practical for internet-based communication), HTTP and HTTPS map to the **Application Layer**. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Application Layer**:  
   - **HTTP/HTTPS** operate here for client-server communication. 

2. **Transport Layer**:  
   - Uses **TCP** to ensure reliable data delivery (with sequence numbers, acknowledgments, etc.).  
   - HTTPS also uses **TLS/SSL** encryption to secure the connection.

3. **Internet Layer**:  
   - Uses **IP** to handle addressing and routing of packets.

4. **Link Layer**:  
   - Manages the physical connection between nodes (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).

## **Key Takeaways: HTTP and HTTPS Models**
- **HTTP and HTTPS rely on the TCP/IP model** for practical implementations but can also be mapped to the **OSI model**.
- **HTTP/HTTPS use TCP** (not UDP) for connection-oriented and reliable communication.
- **HTTPS uses TLS/SSL** encryption over TCP to secure communication.
